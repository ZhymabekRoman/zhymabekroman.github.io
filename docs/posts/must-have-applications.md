These are my recommended must-have applications that you should try to use (at least). Sure, tastes differ, but these apps cover most of my needs. I prefer to use FOSS, and I strive to achieve this in every way possible.

## Linux
### GUI
I use Arch BTW!

1. (NOT-FOSS) [WPS Office](https://www.wps.com/office/linux/) - a full-featured alternative to Microsoft Office, including word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, PDF conversion and more. For me Libre Office is also good, but sometimes it's not correctly opens some documents, and UI is too old for new generation peoples :)
2. (NOT-FOSS) Telegram - a freeware (almost), cross-platform, cloud-based instant messaging, video and audio calling messenger.
3. Kate - lightweight text editor. Developed by KDE team. 
4. (NOT-FOSS) Vivaldi - (pure) open-source web browser. Make you super prodactive.
5. (NOT-FOSS) Obsidian - second brain.
6. (NOT-FOSS) Puffin Browser - Chromium based browser. Use cloud server to render pages. Good solution for low end PC and laptop devices. Installation guide for Linux - [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ZhymabekRoman/Puffin-Browser-on-Linux)

### CLI
1. fish - best alternative for bash, sometimes it's unusual but convenient. Not compatible with POSIX syntax. As an alternative I've tried using ZSH with OhMyZSH configs, but for me it's slow.
2. vim - terminal based IDE. Personal config - [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ZhymabekRoman/dotconfig). As an alternative I've tried to using NeoVIM, but for me it's not convenient.
3. NextDNS - DNS with ad blocker functionality.
4. [WARP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/) - mini "VPN" from Cloudflare.

## Android
1. Termux - GNU utils on your Android smartphone. Free and Open Source.
2. MT Manager - file manager with APK modification toolkits. As an alternative I can recommend MiXplorer.
3. Obsidian - second brain.
4. Nova Launcher - lightweight launcher for Android.
5. Bitwarden - FOS password manager.
6. Apktool M - multi-functional APK modification toolkit application.
7. WPS Office - one application for all Office formats, not like a Microsoft Office with 10000+ app for every format and functionality, and without Windows register inside application (yeah, disk space leak).
8. Telegram for primary account and my custom Forkgram fork for other accounts.
9. WhatsApp - a big "backdoor" application in your smartphone. I use modification from [Fouad](http://down.fouadmods.com).
10. Spotify and Dezeer - as a musician I need high quality music, so I prefer to use music services instead some sort of shit like VK or Yandex music.
11. As borwser I preffer to use Bromite WebView with Fulguris browser, or Kiwi Browser.
12. Google Keep Note - light weight notepad application for small thoughts. There may be better notepads there, but for me this is enough.
13. Obsidian - second brain of my entire life.
14. NextDNS - DNS with ad blocker functionality. Use System DOH setting if you have a newer (=>10) Android version.
15. Easy Voice Recorder - best multi-functional application for audio recordings.
16. QuickEdit - simple but powerful text editor.
17. NeoBackup - application backup toolkit. Free and Open Source.
18. Yandex Keyboard - multi-functional and convenient keyboard.
19. As proxy (VPN) I prefer to use:
    [NekoBoxForAndroid](https://github.com/MatsuriDayo/NekoBoxForAndroid) - all-in-one proxy manager.
    ProtonVPN - privacy orintied VPN service from Switzerland (yeah, we known it - https://www.rt.com/news/534130-swiss-protonmail-french-climate/).
    1.1.1 (aka WARP) - mini "VPN" from Cloudflare.
20. DVGet - lightweight download manager. I prefer to use lightweight version - [4pda](https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?showtopic=280941&view=findpost&p=117089212)
