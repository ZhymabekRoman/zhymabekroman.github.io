For Windows, we have a number of keygen activators that allow we to use Transcribe! free of charge. For Linux, these keygens are not compatible, so we have to do something about that. Without many words, let's just give you a script that will reset the trial version of Transcribe!

```bash
rm ~/.yeqwqauh ~/.Transcribe!7
```

Yep, that is :) Deleting these files will reset Transcribe! settings, including trial information.
